## Introduction - chat

Geolocation, the process of determining the physical location of an object or individual, has become a crucial aspect of modern navigation and location-based services. As the world continues to embrace the digital era, the need for efficient, accurate, and accessible geolocation methods is more significant than ever. While traditional approaches, such as GPS and Wi-Fi positioning, have provided solutions in many contexts, challenges remain, especially in urban environments with limited satellite visibility or in areas where precise location data is not readily available.

One promising method that has gained attention in recent years is geolocation based on streetview images. Streetview imagery, captured by platforms like Google Street View, offers rich, detailed visual data of urban landscapes, streets, and buildings. This wealth of visual information presents an innovative avenue for geolocation systems, utilizing computer vision and image recognition techniques to estimate locations based on visual cues. By matching distinctive features found in images to a geographic database, it is possible to pinpoint locations with high accuracy, even in areas with minimal GPS signal.

This thesis explores the concept of geolocation based on streetview images, examining the methodologies, challenges, and potential applications of using visual data for location estimation. The key objective is to understand how streetview imagery can be leveraged for real-time and large-scale geolocation tasks, offering solutions to various problems in urban planning, tourism, transportation, and more.

The research will delve into the integration of computer vision techniques, machine learning algorithms, and geospatial data, all of which play a crucial role in the development of efficient geolocation models based on streetview images. Through a detailed analysis of existing approaches, as well as the development of novel methodologies, this thesis aims to contribute to the advancement of the field, providing a comprehensive understanding of the potential and limitations of this innovative approach to geolocation.

In summary, this thesis presents an investigation into the use of streetview images for geolocation, focusing on how visual data can supplement traditional geolocation methods and provide a new dimension of accuracy and efficiency. The work is intended to inspire future research and applications that harness the power of imagery and geospatial data to enhance location-based services and technologies.

## 1.1 Motivation

## State of the art

Even though the main problem of this work still hasnâ€™t been resolved, there are some
attempts at trying to solve it. In this chapter we will go over relevant work on the geolocation.

## 2.1 Literature review

One early approach, proposed by Hays and Efros (2008), used landmark recognition in images to estimate the location of a camera. They developed a method to associate specific visual features with geographic locations, which was further improved by incorporating image matching techniques that use keypoints in images to find similarities across large datasets . FollowZhou et al. (2010) demonstrated how the spatial arrangement of visual features in images could be used for accurate geolocation, even when faced with challenging urban environments .

*Google St, launched in 2007, has provided a rich source of geospatial imagery that has since been widely studied for geolocation purposes. One notable approach is the use of image-to-map matching algorithms, where streetview images are compared to a geographic database to estimate location. Keller et al. (2013) proposed a method for matching panoramic streetview images to 3D maps to determine location with high precision, showcasing how geospatial data and image data can be integrated effectively . More recent developments deep learning techniques to automate the process of visual feature extraction and matching, further improving the accuracy and scalability of these systems .
