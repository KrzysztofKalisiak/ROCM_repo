## Introduction - chat

Geolocation, the process of determining the physical location of an object or individual, has become a crucial aspect of modern navigation and location-based services. As the world continues to embrace the digital era, the need for efficient, accurate, and accessible geolocation methods is more significant than ever. While traditional approaches, such as GPS and Wi-Fi positioning, have provided solutions in many contexts, challenges remain, especially in urban environments with limited satellite visibility or in areas where precise location data is not readily available.

One promising method that has gained attention in recent years is geolocation based on streetview images. Streetview imagery, captured by platforms like Google Street View, offers rich, detailed visual data of urban landscapes, streets, and buildings. This wealth of visual information presents an innovative avenue for geolocation systems, utilizing computer vision and image recognition techniques to estimate locations based on visual cues. By matching distinctive features found in images to a geographic database, it is possible to pinpoint locations with high accuracy, even in areas with minimal GPS signal.

This thesis explores the concept of geolocation based on streetview images, examining the methodologies, challenges, and potential applications of using visual data for location estimation. The key objective is to understand how streetview imagery can be leveraged for real-time and large-scale geolocation tasks, offering solutions to various problems in urban planning, tourism, transportation, and more.

The research will delve into the integration of computer vision techniques, machine learning algorithms, and geospatial data, all of which play a crucial role in the development of efficient geolocation models based on streetview images. Through a detailed analysis of existing approaches, as well as the development of novel methodologies, this thesis aims to contribute to the advancement of the field, providing a comprehensive understanding of the potential and limitations of this innovative approach to geolocation.

In summary, this thesis presents an investigation into the use of streetview images for geolocation, focusing on how visual data can supplement traditional geolocation methods and provide a new dimension of accuracy and efficiency. The work is intended to inspire future research and applications that harness the power of imagery and geospatial data to enhance location-based services and technologies.

## 1.1 Motivation

the motivation for this thesis is rooted in the desire to explore how streetview images can be harnessed as a viable and powerful tool for geolocation. This research is driven by the goal of developing a deeper understanding of how visual information can complement traditional geolocation systems, and to provide innovative solutions to longstanding challenges in positioning technologies.

## 1.2 Objectives

The objective of this thesis will be to propose a solution to a geolocation problem leveraging state-of-the art methods and explore further development possibilities. Additionally all resulting materials are gonna be easily availible for further use.

## State of the art

Even though the main problem of this work still hasnâ€™t been resolved, there are some
attempts at trying to solve it. In this chapter we will go over relevant work on the geolocation.

## 2.1 Literature review

One early approach, proposed by Hays and Efros (2008), used landmark recognition in images to estimate the location of a camera. They developed a method to associate specific visual features with geographic locations, which was further improved by incorporating image matching techniques that use keypoints in images to find similarities across large datasets. For features extracted for the algorithm one can distinguish line features, Gist Descriptors and Geometric Context, later on autors used Nearest Neighbors algoritms achiving up to 16% of accuracy understood as whether real location lies within 200km of best estimate.

Further projects include usage of Deep Neural Networks, mailny in CNN configuration, Theethira and Ravindranath (2020) developed a CNN/LSTM model whose goal was to predict one of the 243 USA grid cells, they used 29160 pictures / 9720 locations as each location are 3 120 degree photos. There were 2 models tested, one with pretrained ResNet model and one with trained ResNet model, neither of them performed siginificantly well with best model consisting of pretrained ResNet achieved average error of 1900 kilometers. For reasons of such pure performance authors considered short model training (only 20 epochs).

There were also few proposed solutions published on Github like Stelath (2022) who trained model with 50k photos and also based on ResNet again not achiving any significanly good accuracy.

Most recent and most successfull solution was proposed by Haas, Skreta, Alberti and Finn (2024) with their remarkably good paper called "PIGEON". In their work authors leveraged CLIP feature extractor, introudced new loss function which's goal was to emulate regression like information transfer between different classes of categorical classifier. Autors used 400k photos from all around the world (100k locations, each described by 4 90degree photo). Their acheieved accuracy was 91.96% on country level prediction and 251.6 km mean error.

## 2.2 Data description

For purpose of model developemnt multiple datasets were gathered including photo database, regional GDP data and meteorological data.

### 2.2.1 Administrative bounding data

In order to define bounding areas as well as to allow assignment of each sampled point to its corresponding 'subregion'. Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics - NUTS classification was selected as proper clustering engine. Modelling level, previously called subregion is NUTS 3 level classification. It consists of 1165 regions carefully defined in order to allow for framing of UE regional policies and carrying out socio-econmic analyses of the regions. Therefore each region can be treated as somehow homogenous.

### 2.2.2 Street View data wrangling

Street View data had been gathered with usage of Google Street View Static API, such API allows to download closest image to provided geographical coordinates, its functionality supports size up to 640x640 and FOV up to 120 degrees, almost all availible points have availible full panorama.

Areas valid for sampling were defined as those covered by NUTS dataset, namely those countries are:

AT
BE
BG
CY
CZ
DE
DK
EE
EL
ES
FI
FR
HR
HU
IE
IT
LT
LU
LV
MT
NL
PL
PT
RO
SE
SI
SK


Before sampling points and download them via API there was a process to generate sampling density, for best quality of infered information sampling density shouldn't be uniform. Such apporach has 2 main limitations;

1. Majority of teritory of Europe are actually rural areas without any significant learnable beta (features) for model to train on. Best case scenario would be to have some sort of 50:50 split between rural and urban areas.
2. Not in every country coverage of streetview is equall, there are many countries with scathered coverage like Germany, Serbia, Albania etc, for such countries uniform sampling density wouldn't work as they would be highly underepresented.

The resulting soution will consist of 2 steps:

1. Uniform load with each country selection probability being proportional to it's size in comparison to Europe (all sampled regions).
2. Uniform load from areas marked as 'Urban Morphological Zones' from European Enviromental Agency with each country selection probability being proportional to it's size in comparison to Europe (all sampled regions).
